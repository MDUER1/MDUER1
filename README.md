🎓I'm a student at UCPH, studying economics and mathematics.

💡 I build and develop projects focused on finance and other areas that pique my interest.

My main tech stack includes SQL, R, Python and C++ along with their associated libraries📚. I’m also interested in applying machine learning to finance and use BI tools + Excel when needed.

I work well independently but excel in collaborative environments.

📌 Some projects are pinned below, so feel free to check them out!

And if you'd like to connect - reach out on LinkedIn or Gmail.

I'm always looking for new opportunities🚀!

- ☕ I like tea.
- 👨‍🍳 I enjoy cooking.
- 🏋️‍♂️ Lifting and running is my jam.
- 🤠 Love spending time with friends and family!
