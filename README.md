🎓I'm a student at UCPH, studying economics and mathematics.

I build and develop projects focused on finance and other areas that pique my interest.

My main tech stack includes SQL, R, Python and C++ along with their associated libraries. I’m also interested in applying machine learning to finance and use BI tools + Excel when needed.

I work well independently but excel in collaborative environments.

Some projects are pinned below, so feel free to check them out!

And if you'd like to connect - check out my LinkedIn.

I'm always looking for new opportunities!

Fun Facts:
- I like tea.
- I enjoy cooking.
- Lifting and running is my jam.
- Love spending time with friends and family!
